# Java Foundations

## Overview

Hi, welcome to this repository!

It contains files from my guided Java Foundations class for a simple Java Console application.

Do note that the application is not an executable, nor does it take any user inputs. Hence, if you want to test its functions, you will need to clone the repository into your Java Workspace and run the project in your Java IDE. I used Eclipse as my IDE.

## Topics

This application includes various concepts such as:
* Creating Simple Java Classes
* Inheritance and Arrays
* Java Library Classes and Collections
* Functional Programming
