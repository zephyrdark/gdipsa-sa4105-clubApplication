# Java Foundations

## Overview

Hi, welcome to this repository!

It contains files from my guided Java Foundations class for a simple Java Console application, and I would like to reflect on my learnings here. The design of the application was provided to me in class. I have no prior knowledge of Java. I have some experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Python from my prior classes, 4 months before this class.

Do note that the application is not an executable, nor does it take any user inputs. Hence, if you want to test its functions, you will need to clone the repository into your Java Workspace and run the project in your Java IDE. I used Eclipse as my IDE.

## Topics

This application includes various concepts such as:
* Creating Simple Java Classes
* Inheritance and Arrays
* Java Library Classes and Collections
* Functional Programming

### Creating Simple Java Classes

Coming from C#, the concept of Classes is familiar to me. I understand that classes are necessary to achieve the desired state of "high cohesiveness and low coupling" via Object-Oriented Programming concepts: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

In this application, the `Person` class was created to contain attributes such as `surName`, `firstName`, `lastName`, which are common data stored to identify persons in a Club environment. The `Person` class can then serve as a base for future classes that involve persons. The `Facility` class contains attributes `name` and `description`.

Key differences:
1. Getters & setters are more verbose, but can be auto-generated by the IDE.
2. Getters & setters are accessed by calling their respective functions i.e., `getName()` instead of variable names.

### Inheritance and Arrays

The concept of Inheritance encourages the extending of classes based on the reusability of attributes, constructors, and functions for functionally similar Objects.

A `Member` class is created to store data of individual club members. It extends the `Person` class. A `Club` class is also created so that the application can create multiple Club instances, where each of them stores data of their own club members.

A `Member[]` array is initially chosen to store the Club's `Member` Objects. Due to the fixed-size nature of arrays, it can run out of space to store the `Member` Objects. A function was therefore created to expand the `Member[]` array everytime a new `Member` needs to be added into it.

Key differences:
1. A parent class is referred to as `super` in Java.
2. If a child Class is extends from a super Class and implements a method with the same signature as the super Class's, there is no indication that the super Class's method is overriden in the said child class. Thus, the convention is to include an `@Override` annotation above the overriden method.

### Java Library Classes and Collections

The Java Library contains many useful Classes that are meant to solve common issues. Such Classes include the `List` and `ArrayList`, which are improved versions of `array` that can resize dynamically and contain commonly used Class methods such as `.add(E e)` `.remove(Object o)`.

The`Member[]` array is now replaced with `ArrayList<Member>` which resizes dynamically.
